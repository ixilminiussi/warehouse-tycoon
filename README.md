## Stack, Toss, and Profit
*Ludum Dare 53 (theme: Delivery)*

Get ready to test your puzzle-solving skills in this challenging game about running a warehouse! With limited funds for every trip, it’s up to you to strategically stack as many boxes as possible in your truck, even if it means tossing some aside and risking it all for a bigger payout. Can you fill your trunk to the brim and make the most profit?
### Controls

* right-click / arrow keys to rotate

This was my first Ludum Dare, my first solo game jam and my second ever game. I’m really happy with the result, it may not be as flashy but I took the time to tune the balance of the game and focus on a polished experience. Unfortunately, no time for music, but I would recommend “Lofi girl” in the background. :)

I apologize for the lack of MacOS / HTML5 version, it seems Godot 4 has problems with that.
